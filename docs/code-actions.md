# Code Actions

Code Actions allow you to perform additional actions for [diagnostics](
./diagnostics.md).

Code Actions can be triggered in two ways:

1. By mousing over a diagnostic with code actions
2. By using the `diagnostics:show-actions-at-position` command while the cursor
   is on top of a diagnostic with code actions
